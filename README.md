ENUID is a AI lab, a focused and independent space where intelligence is studied, questioned, built, broken, and rebuilt until it's actually useful. The mission is not to impress the world. It is to change what's possible. We believe the next generation of intelligence should not be built by accident. Instead intelligence should be built by intention, deliberately and with care. ENUID is a lab for intelligence that works rather than merely performs. Our aim is intelligence that thinks, adapts, and respects the humans using it.

first product is Fluid Orbit. It is a “Shopping OS”: a conversational system that understands your intent when you describe what you want, and it finds the best options across the internet without monopolized marketplaces or ads or sponsors, because trust, quality, and convenience matter to us. We’re starting with search, then expanding into a full conversational shopping OS where users can search, compare, buy, and receive products, with try-ons, agentic checkout, tracking, and delivery all handled in one place. We’re building the future of shopping.

The current state of intelligence whether in AI, e-commerce or in any industry often values hype and trends. ENUID challenges that by building systems with purpose, clarity, and human respect. For us, intelligence is not a badge. It's a responsibility. A system that helps people find what they truly need whether it's information or products must be built transparently, ethically, and with care.

ENUID is not chasing trends. We are building tools that should exist. Tools that matter, for people. We are building tools that should exist. Tools that matter.
BUILD FOR PEOPLE!
